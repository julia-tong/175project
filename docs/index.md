Summary:

Our project is to recreate tetris in Minecraft using Malmo. Our goal is to use a combination of reinforcement learning and neural networks for our AI. The game will be in survival mode, so our AI is not trying to win necessarily, but it will try to keep the game running as long as possible without having the blocks reach the very top.
