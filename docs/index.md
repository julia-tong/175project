####We recreated the game of Tetris in Minecraft using the open source repository for AI development Project Malmo. Our goal is to use a combination of reinforcement learning algorithms and neural networks to train and evaluate the AI. The standard game mode in our version of Tetris will be in survival mode, so our AI will not reach any end or win state necessarily, but will try to keep the game running as long as possible without losing when the blocks reach the very top.  See more details about this project in the tabbed links above.
